FlowerGarden.pro 
• Prolog program helps design a garden by arranging flowers based on specific rules to create valid garden of 28 flowers.

chainMatrix.c 
• Developed and implemented an efficient algorithm to determine the optimal order of multiplying matrices in a chain using dynamic programming 
• Reduced computational complexity and improved performance by achieving a significant reduction in time complexity from O(n3) to O(n2)

cpuSimulator.java
• Developed a CPU simulator to simulate the execution of assembly instructions, facilitating understanding of CPU architecture and instruction execution pipelines 
• Implemented caching technique of Least Recently Used to improve in the speed

frequencyAnalysis.py
• Implemented python libraries to create a frequency analysis tool which collects information of single, double, and three letter sets to isolate the patterns in the text inputed
